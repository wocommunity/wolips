at least to the same extent as this License.

3.  Permitted License Uses And Restrictions
3.1  License to Develop Application Programs.  If the software package

conditions of this License, Apple grants to you a personal, non-exclusive 
license to:

 (a)  Install and use a single copy of the Apple Software on one (1) 
Authorized Development System, solely for the purpose of developing 
application programs.

 (b)  Use the Yellow Box for Windows files and run-time libraries

Runtimes") only on your Authorized Development System for the sole purpose 
of operating, and only to the extent necessary to operate, the development 
tools that are included as part of the Apple Software or used for 
developing Apple Software application programs.  Except as expressly 
stated above, no other license, express or implied, is granted with 
respect to the Yellow Box for Windows Runtimes.

 (c)  Access and use the restricted deployment functionality of the Apple

communicating with the Apple Software installed and executed on the 
Authorized Deployment System.

(d)  Reproduce and distribute, both manually and automatically over a 
network, components of the Apple Software (excluding the Yellow Box for 
Windows Runtimes) for installation and use by Java Client End Users on any 
remote computer's non-volatile memory (e.g. ROM) to enable Java Client 
functionality solely for communicating with the Apple Software installed

Client End Users who are not employees or contractors of your 
organization, are shown and accept, by means that are legally enforceable 
in the jurisdiction to which the Apple Software components are 
distributed, the following terms prior to their use of the Apple Software 
components:

Certain components ("Apple Software") included in the software are 
licensed, not sold, to you by Apple Computer, Inc. ("Apple"), and Apple 
reserves all rights not expressly granted to you by these terms. Apple 
grants to you a personal, nonexclusive to install and use the Apple 
Software to enable Java Client functionality solely for communicating with 
Apple's proprietary WebObjects software installed and executed on a remote 
server computer. You may make one copy of the Apple Software for backup or 
archival purposes. Except as and only to the extent expressly permitted 
herein or by applicable law, you may not copy, decompile, reverse 
engineer, disassemble, modify, or create derivative works of the Apple 
Software or any part thereof.

YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE 	APPLE SOFTWARE IS 
AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, 
PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY AND EFFORT IS WITH YOU. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED 
BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE APPLE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITH ALL FAULTS 
AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND APPLE HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES 
AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLE SOFTWARE, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED 
OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR 
CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT 
OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.  APPLE DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH 
YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE APPLE SOFTWARE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE 
APPLE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE 
APPLE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE 
APPLE SOFTWARE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE 
GIVEN BY APPLE OR AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A 
WARRANTY.  SHOULD THE APPLE SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE 
ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  SOME 
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR 
LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE 
EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 
	
TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL APPLE, 
BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES 
FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER 
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OR 
INABILITY TO USE THE APPLE SOFTWARE, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE 
THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF APPLE HAS 
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT 
ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  In no 
event shall Apple's total liability to you for all damages (other than as 
may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) 
exceed the amount of five dollars ($5.00).  The foregoing limitations will 
apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.

You may implement acceptance of such terms by Java Client End Users via 
the Internet, online service or other reasonable manner of your choosing; 
however, it is your responsibility to ensure that such acceptance is 
legally enforceable under and otherwise complies with the relevant laws of 
the jurisdiction in which the Apple Software components are distributed.

3.3  Restrictions on Evaluation Release. Should Apple provide you an 
evaluation serial number enabling you to install the Apple Software, then 
Apple grants to you a time restricted license to use the Apple Software to 
develop application programs under the terms of Section 3.1 and to deploy 
application programs developed using the Apple Software under the terms of 
Section 3.2 on your Authorized Deployment System for trial use and 
evaluation purposes only. All rights to the Evaluation Release will
