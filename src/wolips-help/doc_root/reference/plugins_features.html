<h1>Plug-ins, Features and Fragments</h1>

<p><i>&quot;The Eclipse Platform is an IDE for anything, and for nothing in particular.&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;Although the Eclipse Platform has a lot of built-in functionality, 
  most of that functionality is very generic. It takes additional tools to extend 
  the Platform to work with new content types, to do new things with existing 
  content types, and to focus the generic functionality on something specific.&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;The Eclipse Platform is built on a mechanism for discovering, integrating, 
  and running modules called plug-ins. A tool provider writes a tool as a separate 
  plug-in that operates on files in the workspace and surfaces its tool-specific 
  UI in the workbench. When the Platform is launched, the user is presented with 
  an integrated development environment (IDE) composed of the set of available 
  plug-ins.&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;A plug-in is the smallest unit of Eclipse Platform function that can 
  be developed and delivered separately. Usually a small tool is written as a 
  single plug-in, whereas a complex tool has its functionality split across several 
  plug-ins. Except for a small kernel known as the Platform Runtime, all of the 
  Eclipse Platform's functionality is located in plug-ins.&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;The Eclipse Platform's update manager downloads and installs new features 
  or upgraded versions of existing features (a feature being a group of related 
  plug-ins that get installed and updated together). The update manager constructs 
  a new configuration of available plug-ins to be used the next time the Eclipse 
  Platform is launched. If the result of upgrading or installing proves unsatisfactory, 
  the user can roll back to an earlier configuration. &quot;</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;Plug-ins are coded in Java. A typical plug-in consists of Java code 
  in a JAR library, some read-only files, and other resources such as images, 
  web templates, message catalogs, native code libraries, etc. Some plug-ins do 
  not contain code at all. One such example is a plug-in that contributes online 
  help in the form of HTML pages. A single plug-in's code libraries and read-only 
  content are located together in a directory in the file system, or at a base 
  URL on a server. There is also a mechanism that permits a plug-in to be synthesized 
  from several separate fragments, each in their own directory or URL. This is 
  the mechanism used to deliver separate language packs for an internationalized 
  plug-in.&quot;</i></p>
<p>Plug-ins provide functionality to Eclipse. Their code and other contents may 
  be organised in fragments. Plug-ins are grouped and mangaged as features. Currently 
  WOLips consists of 4 plug-ins, grouped as 3 features. The main plug-in is organised 
  in 9 fragments.</p>
