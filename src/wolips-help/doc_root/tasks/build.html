<h1>Building WebObjects Applications</h1>
<p>WOLips is built on WOProject. That means the WebObjects frameworks and applications 
  are built using Ant scripts. These scripts may be executed internally (to Eclipse) 
  or as an External Tool. WOLips also contains an <a href="#incrementalbuilder">IncrementalBuilder</a> 
  and a <a href="#targetbuilder">TargetBuilder</a>. These were originally developed 
  outside the WOProject/WOLips project, but are now integral parts.</p>
<p>To execute the Ant build script:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Ant view (It is part of the WOLips perspective, and can be added 
    to any other perspective.)</li>
  <li>Make sure the script you want to execute is listed in the view - do Add 
    Build Files.</li>
  <li>Run the appropriate script/target - double-click the target.</li>
</ol>
<p>or</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the project's build script (do this in the Navigator view).</li>
  <li>Right-click on the script and select Run Ant (Make sure you only select 
    one target).</li>
</ol>
<p>To execute the Ant build script as an external tool:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the project's build script (do this in the Navigator view).</li>
  <li>Run &gt; External Tools &gt; Run As &gt; Ant Build</li>
</ol>
<p>In the <a href="../reference/preferences.html#plugin_wolips_build">preferences</a> 
  you can configure WOLips to run the when JavaBuilder is invoked. </p>
<p>Ant scripts are highly <a href="../tips/building.html">configurable</a>...</p>
<h2><a name="incrementalbuilder"></a>Using IncrementalBuilder</h2>
<p>Developing a WebObjects &quot;project&quot; often involves developing a number 
  of framework:s and woa:s simultaneously. When you run or debug applications 
  you do, of course, want to make sure you always use the latest version of every 
  single piece of code. Executing the Ant script for a framework (re-building 
  the entire framework) everytime anything in that framework changed may become 
  impractical.</p>
<p>Eclipse always (and incrementally) keeps all Java code compiled and ready to 
  be executed and/or used by other Eclipse projects. WO projects are more than 
  just Java projects - so this &quot;always ready&quot; mechanism needs to be 
  extended to work with WO projects. This is what IncrementalBuilder does. During 
  development IncrementalBuilder replaces the Ant scripts. It does however not 
  produce installable frameworks or applications. You still need the Ant scripts 
  for that. The main (only) advantage of replacing the Ant scripts with IncrementalBuilder 
  during development is speed.</p>
<p>To start using IncrementalBuilder all you need to do is check option &quot;Use 
  incremental builder&quot; in the <a href="../reference/preferences.html#proj_wolips">project 
  preferences</a>. There is nothing to configure.</p>
<h2><a name="targetbuilder"></a>Using TargetBuilder</h2>
<p>When you build JavaClient or Direct2JavaClient applications you build two separate 
  targets, one client and one server. These two targets need separate classpaths. 
  Normally you can only have one classpath definition set per project - normally 
  you would need to define one client-project and another server-project. The 
  <a href="../reference/plugins_features.html#targetbuilder">TargetBuilder plug-in</a> 
  contains mechanisms to overcome this limitation - it allows you to develop both 
  the client and server parts in the same project.</p>
<p>The basic idea is to define the targets and store their settings in a file 
  not used for anything else (not normally used by Eclipse). When you build, the 
  settings from this file are applied to the Eclipse project one target at the 
  time. For example; first the server target settings are applied and the server 
  target built, then the same thing happens for the client target and what ever 
  other targets there are. Each build uses the normal Eclipse JavaBuilder. When 
  building is complete the original, or normal, project settings are restored. 
  The Eclipse project classpath set must, of course, contain all resources needed 
  to compile the project's source code. A specific target's classpath would be 
  a subset of the project's.</p>
<h3>Setting Things Up</h3>
<p>The targets and their settings are defined in a file called targets.plist. 
  You have to create and maintain this file manually. You can use <a href="../examples/targets.plist">this 
  example</a> as a template. When you edit it you should remember this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It should be kept directly under the project root.</li>
  <li>'classpath' are absolute paths</li>
  <li>'source', 'output' & 'projectclasspath' must start with '/' and are workspace 
    relative</li>
  <li>'projectclasspath' is a list of references to other projects</li>
  <li>You cannot use variables like NEXT_ROOT</li>
</ul>
<p>The WOLips context menu has two entries; Update TargetBuilder and Remove TargetBuilder. 
  (Although the menu option label is "Update TargetBuilder", a more correct label 
  would be "Remove & Add TargetBuilder".) </p>
<p>WOLips > Update TargetBuilder:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Replaces JavaBuilder with TargetBuilder (changes in .project).</li>
  <li>Updates .classpath with information from targets.plist. (Makes certain all 
    and any resources defined in targets.plist are included in .classpath.) </li>
</ul>
<p>WOLips > Remove TargetBuilder</p>
<ul>
  <li>Removes TargetBuilder and restores JavaBuilder (restores .project). </li>
</ul>
