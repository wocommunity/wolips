</ul>
<h2>1.0.1</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Some minor bugfixes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.0.0</h2>
<ul>
  <li>There has been changes (additions and bug fixes) related to the wobuild.properties 
    file.&lt; It is recommended that you <a href="reference/preferences.html#plugin_wolips">rebuild</a> 
    it.</li>
  <li>For some time there has been a memory leak in the org.eclipse.ant.core plug-in

    version available with the WOLips download.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Some minor bugfixes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.9.8</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Update PB.project is back in the context menu.</li>
  <li>Delete WOComponent currently does nothing.</li>
  <li>To use existing projects with 0.9.8 there some steps to make it work.
    <ol>
      <li>Step 1. Go to the preferences and select rebuild wobuild.properties 
        on next launch, and then restart Eclipse. (If you're on Windows you should 
        then open the newly created wobuild.properties file and replace all single 
        '\' with double '\\' - if there are any.)</li>
      <li>Step 2. Open all .classpath files and replace NEXT_ROOT with NEXT_SYSTEM_ROOT 
        and paths to the Library dir with NEXT_LOCAL_ROOT. (Eclipse now has three 
        class path variables related to WOLips: NEXT_ROOT, NEXT_LOCAL_ROOT and 
        NEXT_SYSTEM_ROOT. Regardless of what NEXT_ROOT points to it cannot be 
        used in the .classpath files.)</li>
      <li>Step 3. Modify your build files. You have to replace wo.woroot with 
        wo.wosystemroot. Make sure that you replace all occurencies.</li>
      <li>Step 4. Have fun!</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>To profile your WOApplication download <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmechanic/">jmechanic 0.4.6</a>.
  Currently the heap summary view freezes Eclipse on MacOS X.
  </li>
